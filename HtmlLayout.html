                <p>Jane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great eastern
                   universities, most specifically Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. 
                   Stanford was referred to as the "Cornell of the West" in 1891 due to a 
                   majority of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates (professors,
                    alumni, or both), including its first president, David Starr Jordan, 
                    and second president, John Casper Branner. Both Cornell and Stanford were 
                    among the first to make higher education accessible, non-sectarian, and open
                     to women as well as men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American 
                     universities to adopt that radical departure from traditional education,
                      and Stanford became an early adopter as well

                  Harvard was established in 1636 by vote of the Great and General 
                  Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1638, it acquired British North
                   America's first known printing press.[19][20] In 1639, it was named 
                   Harvard College after deceased clergyman John Harvard, an alumnus 
                   of the University of Cambridge who had left the school £779 and his
                    library of some 400 volumes.[21] The charter creating the Harvard 
                    Corporation was granted in 1650.
                 </p> 
                <p> 1643 publication gave the school's purpose as "to advance learning and
                   perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to 
                   the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust."[22]
                    It trained many Puritan ministers in its early years[23] and offered a 
                    classic curriculum based on the English university model‍—‌many leaders
                     in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge‍—‌but conformed 
                     to the tenets of Puritanism. Harvard has never affiliated with any
                      particular denomination, though many of its earliest graduates went
                       on to become clergymen in Puritan churches.
